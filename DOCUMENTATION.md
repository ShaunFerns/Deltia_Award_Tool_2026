# DELTA Evaluation Tool - User Guide

This document provides a walkthrough of the key workflows available in this prototype.

## 1. Getting Started

Login with one of the demo accounts provided in the README.
*   **Dr. Alex Rivera (`demo_team1`)**: Best for testing the full Programme Enhancement lifecycle.
*   **Prof. Sarah Chen (`demo_team2`)**: Best for testing the focused Module Evaluation workflow.

## 2. Module Evaluation Workflow
*Target Audience: Module Leads & Programme Chairs*

1.  **Select a Module**: From the Home page or "My Modules" list.
2.  **Start Evaluation**: Click "Evaluate Module" (or "Continue Evaluation").
3.  **Metadata**: Complete the Module Context section (Assessment Profile, Teaching Team size, etc.).
4.  **5 Dimensions**: Progress through the 5 DELTA categories.
    *   Rate indicators (Developing / Consolidating / Leading).
    *   Add qualitative evidence or rationales.
5.  **Completion**: Finish the wizard to see the Module Dashboard with Radar Chart and recommendations.

## 3. Programme Enhancement Workflow
*Target Audience: Programme Chairs Only (Login as `demo_team1`)*

### Step A: Dashboard Overview
*   Navigate to a Programme (e.g., "BA (Hons) in Digital Media").
*   View the aggregate "Programme Pulse" radar chart (averages of all module scores).

### Step B: Taking Stock
*   Go to the **Taking Stock** tab.
*   Review the auto-generated "Evidence Base" (pulled from underlying modules).
*   For each dimension, identify "What we do well" and "Areas for development".
*   Mark specific items as **Priorities** for the coming year.

### Step C: Priority Selection
*   Go to the **Priorities** tab.
*   Review the long-list of priorities identified in "Taking Stock".
*   Select the top items to carry forward into themes.

### Step D: Future Focus (Themes)
*   Go to the **Future Focus** tab.
*   Create **Themes** (e.g., "Assessment Reform").
*   Drag and drop your selected Priorities into these Themes.
*   Write a rationale for why this Theme is important.

### Step E: Action Plan
*   Go to the **Action Plan** tab.
*   Create **SMART Goals** under your Themes.
*   Define Specifics, Measurables, Resources, and Dates.
*   **Visualisation**: Switch to the "Timeline" view to see a Gantt chart of your enhancement plan.

## 4. Troubleshooting

*   **Missing Data?**: If dashboards appear empty, try logging out and back in. The system will re-seed demo data if it detects a corrupted state.
*   **Wrong Access?**: Ensure you are logged in as the correct user. `demo_team2` cannot see Programme-level tabs.
